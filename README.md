## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
In this section i have included the wireframes based on how the site should look. I wanted a easy to navigate page with clear indication.

### Home
This is how the home would look with a navigation bar, search function, and links to more information. It would also include a jumbotron for
the top section of the page.

### Cards
Here there are cards that have a small picture, with the title of an illness and a brief summary. They would also include a link to the correct
information.

### Accordians
On the accordian section there are helplines available with information on these helplines. At the top of the page there is also
a button that links to this section.

srcoll to the top of the page when clicked.
