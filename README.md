## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
In this section i have included the wireframes based on how the site should look. I wanted a easy to navigate page with clear indication.

### Home
This is how the home would look with a navigation bar, search function, and links to more information. It would also include a jumbotron for
the top section of the page.

### Cards
Here there are cards that have a small picture, with the title of an illness and a brief summary. They would also include a link to the correct
information.

### Accordians
On the accordian section there are helplines available with information on these helplines. At the top of the page there is also
a button that links to this section.

### Footer
This will be the footer section with links to social media and a copyright tag. There will also be a back to top button here which will
srcoll to the top of the page when clicked.

### Mobile Design
I have used bootstrap to make the content shrink down and look good for mobile users.


### Accessibility Considerations
I have added alt text to the images for screen readers and i have also included some aria labels.


### Validation

## HTML
I have used a HTML [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to find that i have a few minor bugs to fix
